   ## Observations
    
   * We will need a small hex screwdriver needed for the frame (size not know).
     * Bullet Point 1A
   * Bullet Point 2
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Lower Frame was built.
     * The screws are not entirely secure. The frame is stable enough for flight.
   * The power supply board was soldered to the battery connector.
   * Soldered the ESCs to the PSB.
   * Soldered the XT60 Connector to the cables.
   * Soldered an LED to the PSB for power indication.
   
   ## Next Steps
   
   * %Bring a set of hex screwdrivers.
   * %Bring your own solder.
