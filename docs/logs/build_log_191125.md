   ## Observations
    
   * Might Need flux for future, smaller solders.
   
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Cable Management was undertaken to clean-up cluttered wires on the drone.
   * Connected the receiver to the flight controller (CC3D).
   * Bound receiver and transmitter.
   * Managed to establish a connection between the transmitter and the receiver monitored through the flight configurator LibrePilot.
   * Failed to troubleshoot a persistent issue with LibrePilot that prevented configuration of the flight controller.
      * This issue is widespread among the community and exists despite a determined attempt to solve the problem. We have bought a new board to rectify this problem. It isn't a guarantee that it'll function as intended, however its a gamble we took.

   
   ## Next Steps
   
   * Buying the new board.
   * Saving the configuration to LibrePilot.
   * Calibration.
