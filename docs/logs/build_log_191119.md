   ## Observations
    
   * We will need a small hex screwdriver needed for the frame (size not known).
   * Might Need flux for future, smaller solders.
   
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Lower Frame was built.
     * The screws are not entirely secure. The frame is stable enough for flight.
   * The power supply board was soldered to the battery connector.
   * Soldered the ESCs to the PSB.
   * Soldered the XT60 Connector to the cables.
   * Soldered an LED indicator to the PSB for power indication.
   * Taped off the PSB pads with electric tape as carbon fiber conducts electricity.
   * Assembeld the PSB with the lower frame
   * Ziptied the ESCs to the arms of the
   
   ## Next Steps
   
   * The next steps consists in testing the motors and soldering them to the ESCs.
   * Add the radio receiver for the RC and test it.
   * From there the motors can be fixed to the frame.
   * The Flight controler, receiver and battery can be fixed to the frame.
   * Bring a set of hex screwdrivers (kit).
   * Bring your own solder.
   * Bring longer screws to mount PSB to drone frame.
   * Bring cable ties.
   * Bring lipo battery to test circuit and motors. 
   * USB mini B cable is needed.
