   ## Observations
    
   * We will need a small hex screwdriver needed for the frame (size not known).
   * Might Need flux for future, smaller solders.
   
    
   ## Changes Made
    
   * Software [LibrePilot](https://librepilot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LPDOC/pages/4128780/Downloads "Libre Pilot") was installed.
   * The flight contoller was connected to the computer to test each motor.
   * The motors were tested and soldered in the configuration shown in picture 1.
   * The rest of the frame was built and the battery attatched.
   
   ## Next Steps
   * Bring 4 AA batteries.
   * Solder a proper XT60 male connector.
   * Program the RC and 6 channel receiver.
   * Put on the props
   * Bring velcrostraps for battery mount and cable management.
   * Calibrate the props.
