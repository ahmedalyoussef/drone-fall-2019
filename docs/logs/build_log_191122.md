   ## Observations

   ## Changes Made
    
   * Soldered the XT60 connector on to the power input cables
   * Made a washer out of heatshrink for better fastening for propellers
    * Attempted to test for slip (inconclusive, check gif below).

   * Reciever input connections were installed
   
   
   ## Incidents
   
   * LED indicator short circuited and caused a puff of smoke
